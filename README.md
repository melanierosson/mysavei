# mysavei
React JS website containing condensed savings & investment advice for those that are intimidated by traditional financial documentation.

## goals
#### high-level
* make it easier for Millenials, Generation Z's, and diverse groups to get started with personal savings & investing (outside of any employer 401K plans)
* decrease the wealth gap by encouraging and promoting long-term wealth-building strategies that are not usually accessible to underprivileged groups
#### specific
* make the stock market and investing less intimidating by breaking down some of the most important concepts into manageable, easily understandable portions
* endorse tools (mobile apps) that will be recognizable, free (or extremely inexpensive), and user-friendly for younger generations
* ensure the content and process for beginning to invest takes as little of the users time as possible

## market research
I only did a small amount of market research via online search engines. I couldn't find much more than articles and Youtube videos. None of the sources I found accomplished all of mySavei's goals.
