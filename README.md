# mysavei
ðŸ¤‘ Website containing condensed savings & investment advice for those that are intimidated by traditional financial documentation. Coded in React JS using functional components + hooks with Router and Bootstrap.
>In Progress: http://mysavei.com

## goals
#### high-level
* make it easier for younger generations and underprivileged groups to get started with personal savings & investing (outside of any employer 401K plans)
* decrease the wealth gap by encouraging and promoting long-term wealth-building strategies that are not always accessible to everyone
#### specific
* make the stock market and investing less intimidating by breaking down some of the most important concepts into manageable, easily understandable portions
* endorse tools (mobile apps) that will be recognizable, free (or extremely inexpensive), and user-friendly for today's smart phone users (almost everyone)
* ensure the informative content and process for beginning to invest takes as little of the users time as possible
#### developer
* gain more experience with React JS, React Bootstrap, and React Router
* host a React website and connect it to search engines via various available tools
* practice incorporating structured data to improve SEO
* incorporate as much accessibility-friendly design as possible (which may include a toggling grayscale color skin for color blind viewers)

## market research
I only did a small amount of market research via online search engines. I couldn't find much more than articles and Youtube videos. None of the sources I found accomplished all of mySavei's goals.

## development
#### in progress
This is in a functional state on http://mysavei.com but there are many bugs and refinements that I need to fix. When that is done, I'll be re-developing it in Gatsby, and transferring to Netlify.
