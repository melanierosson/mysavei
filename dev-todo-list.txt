- mobile version of robinhood mobile app dropdown when expanded (needs increased size)
- change mobile version of second step choices to all be stacked buttons, not just reduced height screens
- mobile bottom nav screen feedback link bottom-border alignment on hover
- design -> mobile app dropdown modal link (hover goes white, dark green normally - can there be a better user experience?)
- design -> mobile app store modal windows - maybe include the mobile app icon? or some way to better link the modal to the correct app visually (without reading)
- animations and hover effects
- darkened behind the component content area shape needs to have more space on the bottom (just adding padding or subtracting top margin from the component content shapes didn't work)
